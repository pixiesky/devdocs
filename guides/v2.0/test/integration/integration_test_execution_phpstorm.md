## Running integration tests in PHPStorm

* TOC
{:toc}

When writing new integration tests or during debugging, it is convenient to execute tests from within the the PHPStorm IDE.

Please ensure you have [prepared the integration test environment]({{ site.gdeurl }}test/integration/integration_test_setup.html) before starting.

### Creating an integration test run configuration

Setting up a run configuration for integration tests is very similar to creating a run configuration for unit tests.  

Please refer to [Running unit tests in PHPStorm]({{ site.gdeurl }}test/unit/unit_test_execution_phpstorm.html) for instructions on how to create a basic run configuration.  
Then configure the integration test configuration file to be used.

#### Using the integration test configuration file

The only difference in the run configuration is the integration test `phpunit.xml.dist` or `phpunit.xml` configuration file from the directory `dev/tests/integration` has to be selected.
